Truss-displacement-program

The program is created for static and dynamic analysis of any 2D truss. The results of the program are charts and values of static displacement and natural vibrations.

points file - truss knots and connections \
xyz file - boundary conditions \
force file - load 

Z1 vector - global static displacement vector \
M_ini matrix - global natural vibrations matrix \
f vector - sorted natural vibrations freq with cuted boundary conditions values
